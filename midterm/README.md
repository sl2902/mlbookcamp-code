# Car purchase
The objective of this exercise is to build, train and serve a model which predicts how much a customer would pay for a car based on certain customer attributes. The attributes describing a customer are as follows:
    `customer name`
    `customer email` 
    `country` 
    `gender` 
    `age` 
    `annual salary` 
    `credit card debt`
    `net worth`
The response variable is: `Car Purchase Amount`

# Model selection
Three models were built and trained with their respective hyperparameters: Linear Regression, RandomForest Regressor and XGB Regressor. Based on the metric - RMSE, Linear Regression was the best performing model of the lot.

# How to run and serve the model
git clone the repo
